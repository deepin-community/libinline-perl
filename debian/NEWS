libinline-perl (0.58-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Inline::C was split from the Inline distribution and is now packaged as
  libinline-c-perl.

libinline-perl (0.43-5) unstable; urgency=low

  Note that when you upgrade from perl 5.6 to 5.8, binaries built with
  libinline (this may include compiled objects cached in .Inline/_Inline
  directories) will fail to work with the new version of perl. This is
  because perl's ABI for binaries changed between perl 5.6 and 5.8.

  The solution is to delete and regenerate any such binaries you might have.
  I have not tried to automate this in the Debian package.
